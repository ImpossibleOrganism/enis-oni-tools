    Check the f12; for whatever reason, some hookup between the wasm and
    javascript just isn't working. This is so confusing, bluhhh.

    I can probably not try to use a bundler and then deploy for web, but I don't
    know I'd publish to NPM in that situation. I think there's a build target
    for NPM too.
